# Kata/Empty

Rapid setup for Kata development under PHP + [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

Just follow this easy steps:

1. Download Kata/Empty to an empty directory
2. If you don't have Composer installed then run `curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php`
3. Then setup the namespaces with `php composer.phar install`
4. Start coding within the Kata namespace. That's all!

The file structure is quite simple:

- A `/Kata` directory for your code.
- A `/test/Kata` directory for your tests.
